WP made a unique environment with a huge amount of plugins.
Caching plugin make WP as fast as any static website.
A lot of what you can do with WP easily,
would not be possible in such "UI way" in HUGO.

# Issue(s) with WordPress

WP needs a complicated and expensive environment.
While 50$/year is not too much, for bigger websites 
the bill could easily reach 1000$/month and more. And this price could be much
bigger, if we include regular maintenance of MySql db, 
PHP, WP and plugins.

# Hugo make a deal

## Content creation process

For write a content with HUGO you need:
- Be familiar with Markdown format. I believe that average internet user can learn MD in 15 min.  
  I used [this tutorial](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
  for a while.
- Be patient to delivery time to production, it can take up to few min.

## Development process
For develop with HUGO you need to have a basic knowledge of:
- CLI. Well, any development nowadays can't be without it, right?
